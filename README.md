# project-2
This repository is created for the purpose of rebuilding the Jon Chretien website as close as possible to the original

I used CSS, HTML, and CSS Grids to actually compile this website. 

I used the @import feature as well as pulled fonts from Google apis which gave my version of the 
website a better look.

I still need to make the website responsive for mobile and tablet devices.
